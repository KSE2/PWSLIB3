  11 1. Introduction: This document defines a file format for the secure
  12 storage of passwords and related data. The format is designed
  13 according to current cryptographic best practices, and is believed to
  14 be secure, in the sense that without knowledge of the master
  15 passphrase, only a brute-force attack or a flaw in the underlying
  16 cryptographic algorithm will result in unauthorized access to the
  17 data.
  18 
  19 1.1 Design Goals: The PasswordSafe database format is designed to be
  20 secure, extensible and platform-independent.
  21 
  22 1.2 History: This specification is an evolution of previous
  23 formats. The main differences between version 3 of the format and
  24 previous versions are:
  25 1.2.1. This version addresses a minor design flaw in previous versions
  26 of the PasswordSafe database format.
  27 1.2.3. This version replaces the underlying cryptographic functions
  28 with more advanced versions.
  29 1.2.4. This version allows the detection of a truncated or
  30 corrupted/tampered database.
  31 
  32 Meeting these goals is impossible without breaking compatibility: This
  33 format is NOT compatible with previous (major) versions. Note,
  34 however, that since the data stored in previous versions is a proper
  35 subset of the data described here, implementers may read a database
  36 written in an older version and store the result in the format
  37 described here.
  38 
  39 2. Format: A V3 format PasswordSafe is structured as follows:
  40 
  41     TAG|SALT|ITER|H(P')|B1|B2|B3|B4|IV|HDR|R1|R2|...|Rn|EOF|HMAC
  42 
  43 Where:
  44 
  45 2.1 TAG is the sequence of 4 ASCII characters "PWS3". This is to serve as a
  46 quick way for the application to identify the database as a PasswordSafe
  47 version 3 file. This tag has no cryptographic value.
  48 
  49 2.1 SALT is a 256 bit random value, generated at file creation time.
  50 
  51 2.3 P' is the "stretched key" generated from the user's passphrase and
  52 the SALT, as defined in by the hash-function-based key stretching
  53 algorithm in [KEYSTRETCH] (Section 4.1), with SHA-256 [SHA256] as the
  54 hash function, and ITER iterations (at least 2048, i.e., t = 11).
  55 
  56 2.4 ITER is the number of iterations on the hash function to calculate P',
  57 stored as a 32 bit little-endian value. This value is stored here in order
  58 to future-proof the file format against increases in processing power.
  59 
  60 2.5 H(P') is SHA-256(P'), and is used to verify that the user has the
  61 correct passphrase.
  62 
  63 2.6 B1 and B2 are two 128-bit blocks encrypted with Twofish [TWOFISH]
  64 using P' as the key, in ECB mode. These blocks contain the 256 bit
  65 random key K that is used to encrypt the actual records. (This has the
  66 property that there is no known or guessable information on the
  67 plaintext encrypted with the passphrase-derived key that allows an
  68 attacker to mount an attack that bypasses the key stretching
  69 algorithm.)
  70 
  71 2.7 B3 and B4 are two 128-bit blocks encrypted with Twofish using P' as the
  72 key, in ECB mode. These blocks contain the 256 bit random key L that is
  73 used to calculate the HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) of the
  74 encrypted data. See description of EOF field below for more details.
  75 Implementation Note: K and L must NOT be related.
  76 
  77 2.8 IV is the 128-bit random Initial Value for CBC mode.
  78 
  79 2.9 All following records are encrypted using Twofish in CBC mode, with K
  80 as the encryption key.
  81 
  82 2.9.1 HDR: The database header. The header consists of one or more typed
  83 fields (as defined in section 3.2), terminated by the 'END' type field. The
  84 version number field is mandatory. Aside from the 'END' field, no
  85 order is assumed on the field types.
  86 
  87 2.9.2 R1..Rn: The actual database records. Each record consists of one or
  88 more typed fields (as defined in Section 3.2), terminated by the 'END' type
  89 field. The UUID, Title, and Password fields are mandatory. All non-
  90 mandatory fields may either be absent or have zero length. When a field is
  91 absent or zero-length, its default value shall be used. Aside from the
  92 'END' field, no order is assumed on the field types.
  93 
  94 2.10 EOF: The ASCII characters "PWS3-EOFPWS3-EOF" (note that this is
  95 exactly one block long), unencrypted. This is an implementation convenience
  96 to inform the application that the following bytes are to be processed
  97 differently.
  98 
  99 2.11 HMAC: The 256-bit keyed-hash MAC, as described in RFC2104, with SHA-
 100 256 as the underlying hash function. The value is calculated over all of
 101 the plaintext fields, that is, over all the data stored in all fields
 102 (starting from the version number in the header, ending with the last field
 103 of the last record). The key L, as stored in B3 and B4, is used as the hash
 104 key value.
 105 
 106 3. Fields: Data in PasswordSafe is stored in typed fields. Each field
 107 consists of one or more blocks. The blocks are the blocks of the underlying
 108 encryption algorithm - 16 bytes long for Twofish. The first block contains
 109 the field length in the first 4 bytes (little-endian), followed by a one-
 110 byte type identifier. The rest of the block contains up to 11 bytes of
 111 record data. If the record has less than 11 bytes of data, the extra bytes
 112 are filled with random values. The type of a field also defines the data
 113 representation.
 114 
 115 3.1 Data representations
 116 3.1.1 UUID
 117  The UUID data type is 16 bytes long, as defined in RFC4122. Microsoft
 118  Windows has functions for this, and the RFC has a sample
 119  implementation.
 120 
 121 3.1.2 Text
 122  Text is represented in UTF-8 encoding (as defined in RFC3629), with
 123  no byte order marker (BOM) and no end-of-string mark (e.g., null
 124  byte). Note that the latter isn't neccessary since the length of the
 125  field is provided explicitly. Note that ALL fields described as
 126  "text" are UTF-8 encoded unless explicitly stated otherwise.
 127 
 128 3.1.3 Time
 129  Timestamps are stored as 32 bit, little endian, unsigned integers,
 130  representing the number of seconds since Midnight, January 1, 1970, GMT.
 131  (This is equivalent to the time_t type on Windows and POSIX. On the
 132  Macintosh, the value needs to be adjusted by the constant value 2082844800
 133  to account for the different epoch of its time_t type.)
 134  Note that future versions of this format may allow time to be
 135  specifed in 64 bits as well.
 136 
 137 3.2 Field types for the PasswordSafe database header:

 175 
 176 [2] A universally unique identifier is needed in order to synchronize
 177 databases, e.g., between a handheld pocketPC device and a
 178 PC. Representation is as described in Section 3.1.1.
 179 
 180 [3] Non-default preferences are encoded in a string as follows: The string
 181 is of the form "X nn vv X nn vv..." Where X=[BIS] for binary, integer and
 182 string respectively, nn is the numeric value of the enum, and vv is the
 183 value, {1 or 0} for bool, unsigned integer for int, and a delimited string
 184 for String. Only non-default values are stored. See PWSprefs.cpp for more
 185 details.  Note: normally strings are delimited by the doublequote character.
 186 However, if this character is in the string value, an arbitrary character
 187 will be chosen to delimit the string. Version 0x0309 added database wide
 188 special symbols to the Non-default preferences (0x02).
 189 
 190 [4] If requested to be saved, this is a string of 1s and 0s indicating the
 191 expanded state of the tree display when the database was saved. This can
 192 be applied at database open time, if the user wishes, so that the tree is
 193 displayed as it was. Alternatively, it can be ignored and the tree
 194 displayed completely expanded or collapsed. Note that the mapping of
 195 the string to the display state is implementation-specific. Introduced
 196 in format 0x0301.
 197 
 198 [5] Representation is as described in Section 3.1.3. Note that prior
 199 to PasswordSafe 3.09, this field was mistakenly represented as an
 200 eight-byte hexadecimal ASCII string. Implementations SHOULD attempt to
 201 parse 8-byte long timestamps as a hexadecimal ASCII string
 202 representation of the timestamp value.
 203 
 204 [6] Text saved in the format: nnnnu..uh..h, where: 
 205     nnnn = 4 hexadecimal digits giving length of following user name field
 206     u..u = user name
 207     h..h = host computer name
 208     Note: As of format 0x0302, this field is deprecated, and should be
 209     replaced by fields 0x07 and 0x08. In databases prior to format
 210     0x0302, this field should be maintained. 0x0302 and later may
 211     either maintain this field in addition to fields 0x07 and 0x08,
 212     for backwards compatability, or not write this field. If both this
 213     field and 0x07, 0x08 exist, they MUST represent the same values.
 214 
 215 [7] Free form text giving the application that saved the database.
 216 For example, the Windows PasswordSafe application will use the text
 217 "Password Safe Vnn.mm", where nn and mm are the major and minor
 218 version numbers. The major version will contain only the significant
 219 digits whereas the minor version will be padded to the left with
 220 zeroes e.g. "Password Safe V3.02".
 221 
 222 [8] Text containing the username (e.g., login, userid, etc.) of the
 223 user who last saved the database, as determined by the appropriate
 224 operating-system dependent function. This field was introduced in
 225 format version 0x0302, as a replacement for field 0x05. See Comment
 226 [6].
 227 
 228 [9] Text containing the hostname (e.g., machine name, hostid, etc.) of the
 229 machine on which the database was last saved, as determined by the
 230 appropriate operating-system dependent function. This field was
 231 introduced in format version 0x0302, as a replacement for field
 232 0x05. See Comment [6].
 233 
 234 [10] Database name. A logical name for a database which can be used by
 235 applications in place of the possibly lengthy filepath notion. Note
 236 that this field SHOULD be limited to what can be displayed in a single
 237 line. This field was introduced in format version 0x0302.
 238 
 239 [11] Database Description. A purely informative description concerning
 240 the purpose or other practical use of the database. This field was
 241 introduced in format version 0x0302.
 242 
 243 [12] Specfic filters for this database.  This is the text equivalent to
 244 the XML export of the filters as defined by the filter schema. The text 
 245 'image' has no 'print formatting' e.g. tabs and carraige return/line feeds,
 246 since XML processing does not require this. This field was introduced in 
 247 format version 0x0305.
 248 
 249 [13] Values marked 'Reserved' are know to have been used by customized
 250 versions of PasswordSafe. To ensure compatability beweeen versions,
 251 use of these values should be avoided.
 252 
 253 [14] A list of the UUIDs (32 hex character representation of the 16 byte field)
 254 of the recently used entries, prefixed by a 2 hex character representation
 255 of the number of these entries (right justified and left filled with zeroes).
 256 The size of the number of entries field gives a maximum number of entries of 255,
 257 however the GUI may impose further restrictions e.g. Windows MFC UI limits this
 258 to 25. The first entry is the most recent entry accessed. This field was
 259 introduced in format version 0x0307.
 260 
 261 [15] This field allows a multiple Password Policies per database.  The format is:
 262     "NN{LLxxx...xxxffffnnnllluuudddsssMMSSS...SSS}"
 263 where:
 264      NN = 2 hexadecimal digits giving number of password policies in
 265     field (max. 255).
 266      
 267    Each entry is of the form:
 268      LL = 2 hexadecimal digits giving length of the policy name in bytes
 269      xxx...xxx = The policy name (maximum 255 bytes)
 270      ffff = 4 hexadecimal digits representing the following flags
 271         UseLowercase        0x8000
 272         UseUppercase        0x4000
 273         UseDigits           0x2000
 274         UseSymbols          0x1000
 275         UseHexDigits        0x0800 (if set, then no other flags can be set)
 276         UseEasyVision       0x0400
 277         MakePronounceable   0x0200
 278         Unused              0x01ff
 279     nnn  = 3 hexadecimal digits password total length
 280     lll  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of lowercase characters
 281     uuu  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of uppercase characters
 282     ddd  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of digit characters
 283     sss  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of symbol characters
 284     MM = 2 hexadecimal digits giving the length in bytes of allowed special
 285          symbols, or zero to specify the database default special symbol
 286          set.
 287     SSS...SSS = List of allowed symbols in this policy (maximum 255 bytes)
 288     
 289 This field was introduced in format version 0x030A.
 290 
 291 [16] This fields contains the name of an empty group that cannot be constructed
 292 from entries within the database. Unlike other header fields, this field can appear
 293 multiple times.
 294 
 295 This field was introduced in format version 0x030B.
 296 
 297 [17] An explicit end of entry field is useful for supporting new fields
 298 without breaking backwards compatability.

 330 [1] Per-record UUID to assist in sync, merge, etc. Representation is
 331 as described in Section 3.1.1.
 332 
 333 [2] The "Group" supports displaying the entries in a tree-like manner.
 334 Groups can be hierarchical, with elements separated by a period, supporting
 335 groups such as "Finance.credit cards.Visa", "Finance.credit
 336 cards.Mastercard", Finance.bank.web access", etc. Dots entered by the user
 337 should be "escaped" by the application.
 338 
 339 [3] If the entry is an alias, the password will be saved in a special form 
 340 of "[[uuidstr]]", where "uuidstr" is a 32-character representation of the 
 341 alias' associated base entry's UUID (field type 0x01).  This representation
 342 is the same as the standard 36-character string representation as defined in 
 343 RFC4122 but with the four hyphens removed. If an entry with this UUID is not
 344 in the database, this is treated just as an 'unusual' password.  The alias
 345 will only use its base's password entry when copying it to the clipboard or
 346 during Autotype.
 347 
 348 [4] If the entry is a shortcut, the password will be saved in a special form 
 349 of "[~uuidstr~]", where "uuidstr" is a 32-character representation of the 
 350 shortcut's associated base entry's UUID (field type 0x01).  This representation
 351 is the same as the standard 36-character string representation as defined in 
 352 RFC4122 but with the four hyphens removed. If an entry with this UUID is not
 353 in the database, this is treated just as an 'unusual' password. The shortcut
 354 will use all its base's data when used in any action.  It has no fields of
 355 its own.
 356 
 357 [5] Representation is as described in Section 3.1.3.
 358 
 359 [6] This will be updated whenever any part of this entry is accessed
 360 i.e., to copy its username, password or notes to the clipboard; to
 361 perform autotype or to browse to url.
 362 
 363 [7] This will allow the user to enter an expiry date for an entry. The
 364 application can then prompt the user about passwords that need to be
 365 changed. A value of zero means "forever".
 366 
 367 [8] Although earmarked for Password Policy, the coding in versions prior
 368 to V3.12 does not correctly handle the presence of this field.  For this
 369 reason, this value cannot be used for any future V3 field without causing
 370 a potential issue when a user opens a V3.12 or later database with program
 371 version V3.11 or earlier.  See note [14].
 372 
 373 [9] This is the time that any field of the record was modified, useful for
 374 merging databases.
 375 
 376 [10] The URL will be passed to the shell when the user chooses the "Browse
 377 to" action for this entry. In version 2 of the format, this was extracted
 378 from the Notes field. By placing it in a separate field, we are no longer
 379 restricted to a URL - any action that may be executed by the shell may be
 380 specified here.
 381 
 382 [11] The text to be 'typed' by PasswordSafe upon the "Perform Autotype"
 383 action maybe specified here. If unspecified, the default value of
 384 'username, tab, password, tab, enter' is used. In version 2 of the format,
 385 this was extracted from the Notes field. Several codes are recognized here,
 386 e.g, '%p' is replaced by the record's password. See the user documentation
 387 for the complete list of codes. The replacement is done by the application
 388 at runtime, and is not stored in the database.
 389 
 390 [12] Password History is an optional record. If it exists, it stores the
 391 creation times and values of the last few passwords used in the current
 392 entry, in the following format:
 393     "fmmnnTLPTLP...TLP"
 394 where:
 395     f  = {0,1} if password history is on/off
 396     mm = 2 hexadecimal digits max size of history list (i.e. max = 255)
 397     nn = 2 hexadecimal digits current size of history list
 398     T  = Time password was set (time_t written out in %08x)
 399     L  = 4 hexadecimal digit password length (in TCHAR)
 400     P  = Password
 401 No history being kept for a record can be represented either by the lack of
 402 the PWH field (preferred), or by a header of _T("00000"):
 403     flag = 0, max = 00, num = 00
 404 Note that 0aabb, where bb <= aa, is possible if password history was enabled
 405 in the past and has then been disabled but the history hasn't been cleared.
 406 
 407 [13] This field allows a specific Password Policy per entry.  This field
 408 is mutually exclusive with the policy name field [0x18]. The format is:
 409     "ffffnnnllluuudddsss"
 410 where:
 411      ffff = 4 hexadecimal digits representing the following flags
 412         UseLowercase        0x8000 
 413         UseUppercase        0x4000 
 414         UseDigits           0x2000 
 415         UseSymbols          0x1000 
 416         UseHexDigits        0x0800 (if set, then no other flags can be set)
 417         UseEasyVision       0x0400
 418         MakePronounceable   0x0200
 419         Unused              0x01ff
 420     nnn  = 3 hexadecimal digits password total length
 421     lll  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of lowercase characters
 422     uuu  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of uppercase characters
 423     ddd  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of digit characters
 424     sss  = 3 hexadecimal digits password minimum number of symbol characters
 425 
 426 [14] Password Expiry Interval, in days, before this password expires. Once set,
 427 this value is used when the password is first generated and thereafter whenever
 428 the password is changed, until this value is unset.  Valid values are 1-3650
 429 corresponding to up to approximately 10 years.  A value of zero is equivalent to
 430 this field not being set.
 431 
 432 [15] A two byte field contain the value of the Double-Click Action and Shift
 433 Double-Click Action'preference value' (0xff means use the current
 434 Application default):
 435 Current 'preference values' are:
 436     CopyPassword           0
 437     ViewEdit               1
 438     AutoType               2
 439     Browse                 3
 440     CopyNotes              4
 441     CopyUsername           5
 442     CopyPasswordMinimize   6
 443     BrowsePlus             7
 444     Run Command            8
 445     Send email             9
 446 
 447 [16] Separate Email address field as per RFC 2368 (without the 'mailto:'
 448 prefix. This field was introduced in version 0x0306 (PasswordSafe V3.19).
 449 
 450 [17] Entry is protected, i.e., the entry cannot be changed or deleted
 451 while this field is set. This field was introduced in version 0x0308
 452 (PasswordSafe V3.25).  This a single byte. An absent field or a zero
 453 valued field means that the entry is not protected. Any non-zero value
 454 means that the entry is protected.
 455 
 456 [18] Each entry can now specify its own set of allowed special symbols for
 457 password generation.  This overrides the default set and any database specific
 458 set. This field is mutually exclusive with the policy name field
 459 [0x18].  This was introduced in version 0x0309 (PasswordSafe V3.26).
 460 
 461 [19] Each entry can now specify the name of a Password Policy saved in
 462 the database header for password generation. This field is mutually
 463 exclusive with the specific policy field [0x10] and with the Own
 464 symbols for password field [0x16]. This was introduced in version
 465 0x0311 (PasswordSafe V3.28).
 466 
 467 [20] An explicit end of entry field is useful for supporting new fields
 468 without breaking backwards compatability.
 469 
 470 4. Extensibility
 471 
 472 4.1 Forward compatability: Implementations of this format SHOULD NOT
 473 discard or report an error when encountering a field of an unknown
 474 type. Rather, the field(s) type and data should be read, and perserved
 475 when the database is saved.
 476 
 477 4.2 Field type identifiers: This document specifies the field type
 478 identifiers for the current version of the format. Compliant
 479 implementations MUST support the mandatory fields, and SHOULD support
 480 the other fields described herein. Future versions of the format may
 481 specify other type identifiers.
 482 
 483 4.2.1 Application-unique type identifiers: The type identifiers
 484 0xc0-0xdf are available for application developers on a first-come
 485 first-serve basis. Application developers interested in reserving a
 486 type identifier for their application should contact the maintainer of
 487 this document (Currently the PasswordSafe project administrator at
 488 SourceForge).
 489 
 490 4.2.2 Application-specific type identifiers: The type identifiers
 491 0xe0-0xfe are reserved for implementation-specific purposes, and will
 492 NOT be specified in this or future versions of the format
 493 description.
 494 
 495 4.2.3 All unassigned identifiers except as listed in the previous two
 496 subsections are reserved, and should not be used by other
 497 implementations of this format specification in the interest of
 498 interoperablity.
