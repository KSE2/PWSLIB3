== New Changes beyond 2.9.0 ==
Adapted the package for usage of the JUtilClasses project. PWSLIB takes
reference to packages 1 and 2 of util-classes 0-12-0.
Class CryptoRandom is now rooted in the JUtilClasses library and supports
enhanced entropy security pf random data. Also rooted in UtilClasses are the
hash functions.

File format 3 now allows to set the length of the Twofish machine encryption
key, which can assume the values 256, 192, 128 and 64. This enables the user
to set lower security level when required. The setting is enabled for 
classes PwsFileHeaderV3, PwsFileInputSocket, PwsFileOutputSocket.
