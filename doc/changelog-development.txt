PWSLIB2 Changelog since 2-3-0

- PwsFile.setPersistentFile(ContextFile) now allows for the null parameter 
  which is equivalent to PwsFile.setFilePath(null).

- new exception  LoginFailureException has been created to replace 
  sun.net.ftp.FtpLoginException. 
  
  - security update for the encryption/decryption process. With thorough memory testing
  some spreading of decrypted content garbage onto the VM (temporary!) data heap have 
  been removed. JPasswords VM memory should be now clean from decrypted database content
  from reading or writing databases, except for Title and User-Name.
